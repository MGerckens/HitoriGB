This is the first project I've written at anywhere near this level of complexity. Sorry if the code is too unreadable. I originally started in late September 2021, when I got sick over a weekend and saw a video about gbdk. I thought it would be a fun weekend project, and definitely did not expect to spend 2 full months of my life on it. It was fun.
